        The tiny, yet mighty, hedgehog
        <span id="species"> <em>(Erinaceus europaeus)</em> </span>is a
        delightful and quirky little creature who is loved both as a pet and as
        an addition to many European gardens. The hedgehog is a sensitive
        creature who is both predator and prey in the wild and leads a very
        sheltered domestic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hedgehog is a mammal whose lifespan averages 2-3 years in the wild
        and 3-6 years as a pet. Their unusual and striking appearenece has made
        them trendy pets in recent years. Hedgehog have a coat of spikiy quills
        on their back. These spikes act as a defensive tactic. When these tiny
        mammals sense danger they curl up into a spiky ball, much like the
        position they take when they hibernate.

        Hedheogs' average weight varies by region but they average aproximately
        2kg. Their tiny size makes them an ideal pet for urban pet owners as
        they require minimal space for exercise and play. Domestic hedgehogs
        enjoy a diet of specially formulated pet food as well as insects
        provided by the pet owner. Pet hedgehogs also enjoy a climate-controlled
        life as concientious pet owners ensure their home is always at least 22
        degresss celsius.

      <p>
        Not unlike domestic hedgehogs, wild hedgehogs are often celebrated for
        their ability to elimate pests in residential gardens. Wild hedgehogs
        used to be classified by the no longer recognized order:
        <span> <em>Insectivoria.</em> </span> Hedgehogs, however, are omnivores.
        They thrive on a diet of worms, snakes, insects, toads, berries,
        grossroots and mushrooms. In the wild, a hedgehogs lifespan is much
        shorter. The average wild hedgehog's lifespan is 2-3 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hedgehogs are delightful pets and widely appraciated as helpers in the
        urban wild. Their gentle demeanor means they pose little danger to
        humans. Unfortunately, headehogs have been introduced to several places
        where they have become an
        <span>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog">invasive species.</a>
        </span>
        As hedgehogs have no natural predator's in countries like New Zealand
        and The Scottish Isles, they have upset the balance of the ecosystem in
        these places.

        Whether you are considering a pet hedgehog or just researching out of
        curiousity, the hedgehog is a fascinating little animal. Between it's
        unusual appearence and gentle nature, hedgehogs have become pets for
        many and the subject of much study. These lovely animal's spikes might
        be a natural defense but these spiky quills add to the appeal of a
        headehog. A common search querey about hedehog was asking how to
        differentiate between a hibernating hedgehog and a dead hedgehog. There
        a few other animals that carry so much mystery. Hedgehog owners swear
        their little friends recognize and play with them and say they are
        wonderful pets. Nothing like a dog or a cat, these spiky little
        creatures are winning hearts around the world.
