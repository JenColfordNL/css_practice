      The European Headgehog, also know as the <span id="hedgehoglink"  >  <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/43042-Erinaceus-europaeus"target=_blank> Common Hedgehog </a>  </span>   is native to Europe but can be found worldwide as pets. This tiny mammal is similar to the porcupine but the hedgehog is much smaller.  The average European Headgehog weighs just 2kg. Hedgehogs' back are covered with spiky quills that stand up when the they feel threatened.  The hedgehog's unusal appearence and gentle and calm demeanor have made them very popular pets in North America in recent years.

    <h2>Hedgehog Habitat</h2>
    
    <p>
        
     The European Hedgehog is found among many different kinds of habitat like meadows and grasslands, as well as orchirds and vineyars.  They are usually found close to human settlements, usually in their gardens or public parks. The hedgehog is an  <span class="invasive"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog"target=_blank>invasive species</a>        </span> in places like  New Zealand and the Scottish Isles.  Like many animals introduced by humans, the hedgehog has no natural predators in these places and the hedehogs' presence wrecks havoc with their natural ecosystems.

    <h2>Headgehog Diet</h2>
    <div class="dietwords">
    <p>
       
        <p>In the wild, hedgehogs are <span>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog"target=_blank> omnivores,</a> </span> which means they eat almost everything. Pet hedgehogs eat specially formulated pet food supplemented by some insects.  If you can't imagine feeding crickets to your new pet, the hedgehog is definitely not an option for you. Hedgehogs usually eat at night and even as pets, like to 'discover' their food.

        <h2>Hedgehog Hibernation</h2>
      <p>
        Pet hedgehogs do not normally hibernate and their cage must be kept at a minimum of 22 degrees to prevent it. Hibernation is triggered in both wiild and domestic hedgehogs by a drop in temperature. In the wild, hedgehogs spend the fall munching on as much as they can find tostore as fat for the winter months. Wild headeghogs often wake up several times during hibernation to eat a little before returning to the state know as <span> <a href="https://hedgehogregistry.org/hedgehog-hibernation/"target=_blank>torpor.</a> </span>
